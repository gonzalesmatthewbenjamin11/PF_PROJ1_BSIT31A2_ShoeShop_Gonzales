# 📦 Shoe Inventory Management System - Assignment Instructions

## 🎯 **MAIN OBJECTIVE**

Build a **Shoe Inventory Management System** using ASP.NET Core MVC with a **3-layer architecture**. Your team will create an admin portal for managing shoe inventory operations including stock tracking, purchase orders, and pull-outs.

### **What You're Building:**
A **comprehensive shoe inventory management system** with:
- 📦 **Inventory Management**: Add shoes, track stock levels, manage color variations
- 📝 **Purchase Orders**: Create orders to restock inventory from suppliers
- 📤 **Pull-Outs**: Remove items from inventory with reasons (damaged, returned, promotional, etc.)
- 📈 **Reports**: Inventory dashboard, low stock alerts, transaction history
- 🔐 **Authentication**: Admin login with role-based access (Admin, Manager, Staff)
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Professional admin interface that works on desktop and mobile
- 🎯 **Traditional MVC**: Server-side rendering with Razor views
